### The Roadmap

GitHub Desktop recently announced its
[1.0 release](https://github.com/blog/2437-announcing-github-desktop-1-0) and
are working towards deprecating the classic Mac and Windows applications.

Beyond that, we are working on a roadmap you can read [here](https://github.com/desktop/desktop/blob/master/docs/process/roadmap.md).
The immediate milestones are more detailed, and the latter milestones are more
fuzzy and subject to change.

 - have low impact, or have a known workaround
 - should be addressed
 - have a narrow scope and/or easy reproduction steps
 - can be worked on independent of other tasks

These issues will be labelled as [`help wanted`](https://github.com/desktop/desktop/labels/help%20wanted)
