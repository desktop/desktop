  Thanks for reaching out!

  We require the
  [template](https://github.com/desktop/desktop/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#how-do-i-submit-a-good-bug-report)
  to be filled out with all new issues. We do this so that we can be certain we
  have all the information we need to address your submission efficiently. This
  allows the maintainers to spend more time fixing bugs, implementing
  enhancements, and reviewing and merging pull requests.

  Thanks for understanding and meeting us halfway 😀
