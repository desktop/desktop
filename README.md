## What is this repository for?

This repository contains specific patches on top of the upstream
`desktop/desktop` repository to support Linux usage.

It also publishes [releases](https://github.com/shiftkey/desktop/releases) for various Linux distributions:

 - AppImage (`.AppImage`)
 - Debian (`.deb`)
 - RPM (`.rpm`)

## Installation via package manager

You can use your operating system's package manager to install `github-desktop` and
keep it up to date on Debian and RPM-based distributions.

### Debian/Ubuntu

There are two APT package feeds available, both hosted in the US. You only need
to add one or the other here, as both of these are generated based on the
releases from this repository.

#### [@shiftkey](https://github.com/shiftkey) package feed

```sh
wget -qO - https://apt.packages.shiftkey.dev/gpg.key | gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/shiftkey-packages.gpg > /dev/null
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb [arch=amd64 signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/shiftkey-packages.gpg] https://apt.packages.shiftkey.dev/ubuntu/ any main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/shiftkey-packages.list'
```

#### [@mwt](https://github.com/mwt) package feed

```sh
wget -qO - https://mirror.mwt.me/shiftkey-desktop/gpgkey | gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/mwt-desktop.gpg > /dev/null
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb [arch=amd64 signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/mwt-desktop.gpg] https://mirror.mwt.me/shiftkey-desktop/deb/ any main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mwt-desktop.list'
```

#### Installation

Once you have a feed configured, run this command to install the application:

```sh
sudo apt update && sudo apt install github-desktop

sudo rpm --import https://rpm.packages.shiftkey.dev/gpg.key
sudo sh -c 'echo -e "[shiftkey-packages]\nname=GitHub Desktop\nbaseurl=https://rpm.packages.shiftkey.dev/rpm/\nenabled=1\ngpgcheck=1\nrepo_gpgcheck=1\ngpgkey=https://rpm.packages.shiftkey.dev/gpg.key" > /etc/yum.repos.d/shiftkey-packages.repo'
```

## Other Distributions

### Arch Linux

Arch Linux users can install GitHub Desktop from the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/github-desktop-bin/).

`gnome-keyring` is required and the daemon must be launched either at login or when the X server is started. Normally this is handled by a display manager, but in other cases following the instructions found on the [Arch Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/GNOME/Keyring#Using_the_keyring_outside_GNOME) will fix the issue of not being able to save login credentials.

### Cross-Distribution Packages

GitHub Desktop is also available cross-platform as a [Flatpak](https://github.com/flathub/io.github.shiftey.Desktop) and [AppImage](https://appimage.github.io/GitHubDesktop/).

### deb-get

Debian/Ubuntu users can also install directly from this repository using [`deb-get`](https://github.com/wimpysworld/deb-get): `deb-get install github-desktop`.

## Known issues

If you're having troubles with Desktop, please refer to the [Known issues](docs/known-issues.md#linux)
document for guidance and workarounds for common limitations.

If your package manager is still trying to reach PackageCloud, refer to the
[cleanup instructions](docs/known-issues.md#the-packagecloud-package-feed-is-no-longer-working)
for details about migrating away.
