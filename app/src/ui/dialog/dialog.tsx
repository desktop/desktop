  /**
   * Attempts to move keyboard focus to the first _suitable_ child of the
   * dialog.
   *
   * The original motivation for this function is that while the order of the
   * Ok, and Cancel buttons differ between platforms (see OkCancelButtonGroup)
   * we don't want to accidentally put keyboard focus on the destructive
   * button (like the Ok button in the discard changes dialog) but rather
   * on the non-destructive action. This logic originates from the macOS
   * human interface guidelines
   *
   * From https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/macos/windows-and-views/dialogs/:
   *
   *   "Users sometimes press Return merely to dismiss a dialog, without
   *   reading its content, so it’s crucial that a default button initiate
   *   a harmless action. [...] when a dialog may result in a destructive
   *   action, Cancel can be set as the default button."
   *
   * The same guidelines also has this to say about focus:
   *
   *   "Set the initial focus to the first location that accepts user input.
   *    Doing so lets the user begin entering data immediately, without needing
   *    to click a specific item like a text field or list."
   *
   * In attempting to follow the guidelines outlined above we follow a priority
   * order in determining the first suitable child.
   *
   *  1. An element marked with the `DialogPreferredFocusClassName` class.
   *     Sometimes we just need a specific element to get focus first, and it's
   *     hard to fit it into the rest of these generic focus rules.
   *
   *  2. The element with the lowest positive tabIndex
   *     This might sound counterintuitive but imagine the following pseudo
   *     dialog this would be button D as button D would be the first button
   *     to get focused when hitting Tab.
   *
   *     <dialog>
   *      <button>A</button>
   *      <button tabIndex=3>B</button>
   *      <button tabIndex=2>C</button>
   *      <button tabIndex=1>D</button>
   *     </dialog>
   *
   *  3. The first element which is either implicitly keyboard focusable (like a
   *     text input field) or explicitly focusable through tabIndex=0 (like a TabBar
   *     tab)
   *
   *  4. The first submit button. We use this as a proxy for what macOS HIG calls
   *     "default button". It's not the same thing but for our purposes it's close
   *     enough.
   *
   *  5. Any remaining button
   *
   *  6. The dialog close button
   *
