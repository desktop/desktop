# First Responder Rotation

We have a first responder rotation. The goals of the rotation are:

1. Ensure community issues and PRs are answered in a timely manner.
1. Ensure support load is shared across the whole team.
1. Free up the rest of the team to focus on milestone work.
1. Allocate time to less prioritized work.

Each rotation is a week long. While first responder your duties are:

1. Triage issues.
  * Follow up or continue any troubleshooting.
  * Review the [more-information-needed](https://github.com/desktop/desktop/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Amore-information-needed) and [needs-reproduction](https://github.com/desktop/desktop/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aneeds-reproduction) issues and close any that have gone 2 weeks with no new activity.
1. Review community pull requests.
1. Address technical debt, pet bugs, etc.
1. Anything that supports the goals outlined above.

It's kind of a [big block of cheese](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm9HZq53rqU) situation.
