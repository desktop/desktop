# Roadmap

The following are our marketing releases, as planned to date (and we plan to revisit 6 months from now). They contain the broad features we're considering. The further away a release is, the less defined it is. Releases are subject to change at any time. This is not written in stone!!!

## 1.3 - Detecting merge conflicts
  
- [Relationship between branches continued](https://github.com/desktop/desktop/issues/2639) - [#2639](https://github.com/desktop/desktop/issues/2639)
  - Notifications around diverging from master branch
  - Detect merge conflicts
  
## 1.4 - New branch, maybe?

- [Move unpublished commits on master to new branch](https://github.com/desktop/desktop/issues/1021) - [#1021](https://github.com/desktop/desktop/issues/1021)
  - Don't let me commit to branches I shouldn't commit to
  - Guide me to creating my own branches 
  
**Note:** depending on things, this might get combined with 1.5

## 1.8 - Messaging + Tracking
